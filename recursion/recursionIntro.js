//1. Write a function that loops through the numbers n down to 0. If you haven't done so try using a while loop to do this.

//2. Next, try looping just like above except using recursion

//3.Write a function 'exponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo, uses a while loop to return the exponenet value of the base.

//4. Write a function 'RecursiveExponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo, recursively returns exponent value of the base.

//5. Write a function 'recursiveMultiplier' that takes two arguments, 'arr and num', and multiplies each arr value by num and returns an array of the values.

//6. Write a function 'recursiveReverse' that takes an array and uses recursion to return its contents in reverse
